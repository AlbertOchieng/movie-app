The purpose of the movie ticket booking application is to automate the existing manual system by the help of an existing fully fledged mobile application, so that valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation of the same. This application can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast booking experience.

Objectives of the project:
To evaluate the existing movie booking systems
To develop a required documentation of the proposed mobile app
To test and validate the proposed Movie booking app
To minimize the number of customers at the reception
To provide anytime, anyplace service for the customer
